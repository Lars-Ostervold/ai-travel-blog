## Unleashing Our Inner Shakespeare: A Family Adventure at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival

Ah, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, located in the delightful town of Ashland. If you told me that at 30, I'd be schlepping two energetic boys to a theater festival, I might've laughed and dismissed the idea. But here we are, living proof that you can blend family and culture in the most theatrical way possible! Grab your feather quills, folks, because I'm here to regale you with our experience.

### Highlights of Our Trip

Let's get this party started with the drama-free moments‚Äîbecause, let's be honest, there are always moments of drama when you're traveling with kids. Our trip was sprinkled with delightful highlights, such as:

1. **The Festival's Captivating Performances**: We managed to catch "Twelfth Night" and "Much Ado About Nothing," both performed under the enchanting Ashland skies. ![Medium shot of actors performing "Much Ado About Nothing" under a starry Ashland night sky, showcasing vibrant costumes and expressive gestures.

Yes, ‚ÄúBenedick‚Äù did not exist in our restaurant anymore‚Äîonly our backyard! 

2. **Strolling Through Lithia Park**: With the sun shining and the squirrels performing acrobatics overhead, Lithia Park became our little enchanted forest. ![A joyful family picnic at Lithia Park featuring a colorful spread of croissants and snacks on a blanket, surrounded by lush greenery and playful children, illuminated by soft afternoon sunlight filtering through the leaves.](https://nxvznoqipejdootcntuo.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/travel-blog-images/image_56_1.png) The kids loved running wild by the creek, and Noah and I savored some much-needed peace while creeping out from behind the bushes like ninja parents. A bit of fresh air and greenery can do wonders, and this park offers plenty of space for the kids to burn off that never-ending energy.

3. **Grandma's Favorite Treat**: We stumbled upon a quaint bakery, **Pangea**, that had the most delicious and buttery croissants known to humankind (sorry, Grandma!). If the pastry gods exist, I'm sure they reside right in Ashland. We grabbed a few and enjoyed a picnic by the park‚Äîa perfect, low-budget, yet utterly delightful experience. ![A joyful 5-year-old boy, Max, reenacting a theatrical character with a playful expression, surrounded by the whimsical trees of Lithia Park, bathed in the golden glow of a setting sun.

### Challenges We Faced

Now, let's not overlook the little bumpers that added to our family tale. Here's what we encountered on our merry way:

1. **The ‚ÄúCan We Go Home Now?‚Äù Dilemma**: Mid-performance, Leo (the 2-year-old supernova) decided he was totally done channeling his inner Shakespeare and started a ‚Äúno more theater, please‚Äù chant, which, let me tell you, was impressive. A quick strategy: we brought a tiny bag of quiet toys that could occupy him while still allowing Max and us to enjoy the show. Parenting hack? Check!

2. **Meal Meltdowns**: Oh, the joys of dining out with kids. ![Street photography of downtown Ashland, showcasing families visiting unique shops and bookstores amidst a bustling atmosphere, with soft golden hour lighting enhancing the scene and conveying a sense of community spirit and adventure.](https://nxvznoqipejdootcntuo.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/travel-blog-images/image_56_3.png) There was one fateful night when Max declared he wouldn't eat anything that looked ‚Äúgreen‚Äù‚Äîveggies, detoxifying juices, even those beautiful garlic saut√©ed greens. So we had to negotiate a kid-friendly pizza with a side of ‚Äúgreen‚Äù-free verdict. My tip? Be flexible, and expect to make peaceful culinary trades. 

### Tips for Visiting the Oregon Shakespeare Festival with Kids

- **Prioritize Family Moments**: Remember: you're there to create memories, not to follow a strict schedule. There are tons of kid-friendly activities around the theater, so leave room for spontaneous adventures.

- **Choose Early or Matinee Shows**: If you want to witness the magic of Shakespeare but keep your sanity intact, opt for matinee performances. Trust me; the last thing you want is a sleepy child falling asleep during a heartbreaking soliloquy (or worse, waking up crying halfway through).

- **Plan Your Snacks**: The concessions can get pricey, so pack a small snack bag! Trail mix, dried fruits, or some mini fruit pouches will do the trick. Kids can snack during intermission, and you'll save a little green.

### Budget-Friendly Activities and Attractions

While theater steals the show, don't miss out on Ashland's more affordable attractions:

- **Explore Downtown Ashland**: Spend an afternoon roaming around the unique shops and bookstores. [Image 5] The imaginative displays are bound to intrigue your kids, and a few sales-toys might find their way into your bag (or at least that's the plan!). 

- **Visit the ScienceWorks Hands-On Museum**: This family-friendly museum is a treasure trove of fun, with interactive exhibits that will keep both kids‚Äîand adults‚Äîengaged for hours.

### Must-Try Local Foods

During our visit, we devoured everything we could get our hands on, but if you're wondering about the local must-tries:

- **Rogue Creamery Cheese**: You can't visit Oregon without sampling some artisanal cheese! We found an amazing cheese shop downtown; their samples are a hit with kids and adults alike. 

- **Ashland's Farmers Market**: Check if your visit coincides with the Farmers Market for fresh produce and delicious snacks from local vendors. Who can resist freshly baked goods and homemade jams?

### Cultural Customs and Etiquette Tips

As a family with a love for culture, we made it a point to embrace local customs. A few pointers:

- **Respect the Performance**: Teaching our kids to appreciate the effort behind live performances was essential. A quick ‚Äúwhisper during quiet moments‚Äù lesson did wonders (until the dramatic outburst‚Ä¶ but no guilt here)!

- **Be Friendly, Not Formal**: Ashland is laid-back. Smile and chat with locals; they're often eager to share their favorite spots or recommendations.

### Final Thoughts

If you're considering a trip to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, I wholeheartedly encourage you to pack up your crew and dive into the world of theater! It may not be a five-star resort vacation, but the stories, laughs, challenges, and blurred lines of parenting paint a masterpiece all on their own. 

So, go ahead‚Äîembrace the adventure, create those unforgettable moments, and who knows, you might find a little Shakespeare within your family, too! üåü
